# dataquest.io: Guided Projects 

This repo consists of all of the guided projects completed while working through the "Data Scientist
in Python" pathway on dataquest.io. 

I have created a folder structure that tries to mirror the eight different steps throughout the "Data Scientist in Python" pathway. Within these folders I added the guided projects which I have thus far completed. For a summary of the eight different steps and links to the guided projects themselves, see below:
